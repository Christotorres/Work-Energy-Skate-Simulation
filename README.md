# Work–Energy Skate Simulation 🛹

A fun interactive game I built for my **Physics Lab final project**.

The goal is to help visualize the **work–energy principle** in a simple and engaging way.  
Players answer multiple-choice questions, and based on their choice, the skateboarder moves along the track.

## 🎮 How It Works
- The user is given a physics-based question
- They choose an answer from multiple options
- The character moves depending on whether the answer is correct
- The motion represents changes in energy during the skate

This project focuses more on **interaction and visualization** than strict realism.

## 🛠️ Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 📚 Why I Made This
I wanted to turn a physics concept we learned in lab into something more interactive than a traditional report.  
This project helped me practice combining **logic, visuals, and user input** in a small game-like format.

## 🚧 Notes
- This is a class project and still a work in progress
- Code and visuals can be improved over time
- Built mainly for learning and experimentation
-PS MOSTLY JUST VIBE CODED
