# Work–Energy Skate Simulation 🛹

This is a small physics simulation that shows the **work–energy theorem** using a skateboarder sliding on a rail.

The goal is to find the **minimum initial speed** the skater needs to make it to the end of the rail without pushing again.

## What This Project Shows

- How kinetic energy changes as the skater moves
- How gravity and friction affect motion on an incline
- How the work–energy equation is used in real situations

---

## Physics Used

- Work–Energy Theorem  
- Friction on an incline  

Equation used:
½mv² = mgd sin(θ) + μmgd cos(θ)

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser  
2. Watch the animation  
3. Answer the physics question  

No setup needed.
